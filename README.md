# Sources for clojure.github.com #
This repo has the source data for [http://clojure.github.com]() which is generated by the rules of [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

Currently, the content on this site is completely generated by an autodoc indexer (see [https://github.com/tomfaulhaber/autodoc-index] for the source) that creates an overview and index of all the libraries that have had documentation pushed from autodoc.

Contact Tom Faulhaber if you have suggestions or want to add new content to this page. Do not directly edit the files here because they will be overwritten the next time the indexer runs.
